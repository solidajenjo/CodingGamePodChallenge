The first level took me 5 minutes. Pretty straightforward, only needed to increase the thrust to win.

This level took me about 10 minutes. I tried to go slow when next to the checkpoint or the absolute value of the angle was more than 30 deg.

In this level I've spent like 2 hours aprox. I tried some different approaches and strategies. Finally I decided to learn the route on the first lap, due the lack of information provided by the game, and use it on the next laps to start turning earlier. I've beat the level without even using the boost.
